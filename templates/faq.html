                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>A novated lease is a three-way agreement between you (the employee), your employer, and the lease company. Your employer pays the lease and vehicle running costs directly from your pre-tax salary, which can reduce your taxable income.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Your employer deducts funds from your pre-tax (and sometimes post-tax) salary to cover your car repayments and agreed-upon running costs (like fuel, insurance, servicing). These deductions are then paid to the lease provider. This 'salary sacrifice' can reduce your taxable income, potentially leading to tax savings.</p>

                    How does Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) apply to novated leases?

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>FBT can apply to the private use of a novated lease vehicle. However, it's often offset by contributions from your post-tax salary, effectively reducing or eliminating the FBT liability for you and your employer. EV/PHEV vehicles often have FBT exemptions.</p>

                    How can Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) impact negatively on pre-tax savings?
                    <span class="icon">▼</span>
                </div>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) is a tax paid by employers on certain benefits provided to their employees, which are not salary or wages. When you use a novated lease, your employer is providing you with a "car fringe benefit" because the lease payments and often running costs are deducted from your pre-tax salary.</p>
                    <p>Technically, your employer is liable for FBT. However, in most novated lease arrangements, this cost is structured to be passed on to the employee through salary deductions. This means that while you gain the benefit of reducing your taxable income through pre-tax payments, a portion of your benefit is subject to FBT. If FBT is not managed, it can offset some of the income tax savings you achieve by salary packaging. For instance, if you pay for everything from pre-tax income and an FBT liability arises, that liability ultimately affects your overall financial benefit from the lease. The FBT rate is currently 47% (equivalent to the highest marginal tax rate plus the Medicare levy), applied to the taxable value of the car benefit.</p>
                    <p>To avoid or reduce FBT, the most common method is the **Employee Contribution Method (ECM)**. This involves making a portion of your novated lease payments (specifically, an amount equal to the FBT taxable value) from your **after-tax** salary. Every dollar contributed post-tax reduces the FBT liability by the same amount, potentially bringing the FBT to zero. While this means some of your payments are post-tax, for many, the combined tax savings still outweigh paying for the car outright.</p>
                    <p>Since July 1, 2022, eligible Electric Vehicles (BEVs, FCEVs, and certain PHEVs until March 31, 2025) under a novated lease are exempt from FBT, provided the car's value is below the luxury car tax threshold. This exemption significantly enhances pre-tax savings as it eliminates the need for post-tax contributions to offset FBT for these vehicles.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>When your employer purchases the vehicle (and pays for running costs) through the lease, they can claim back the GST. This saving is typically passed on to you, reducing the effective price of the car and your running expenses.</p>

                    <p><strong>Underlying Assumptions:</strong><br>Calculators typically make certain assumptions based on ATO guidelines and general market rates. While your calculator provides estimates, for precise figures, it's always recommended to obtain a personalized quote from a novated lease provider who can factor in specific deals, current rates, and your individual circumstances.</p>
